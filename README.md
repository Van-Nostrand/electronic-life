### ELECTRONIC LIFE!

This was once a tutorial I followed which printed a bunch of roving "creatures" as text in the command line  
I've recreated it properly rendered in a browser using React and Typescript  
Currently, the one completed critter is called "BouncingCritter", and it simply moves forwards until it hits a wall, then chooses a new direction at random  
I'm implementing a "WallFollower", which will seek out the nearest wall panel, and then start plotting a route which hugs the wall  
After that, I'll add a predator, and then maybe plants  

# todo
* refactor critters and rendering
* consider refactoring out rem units
